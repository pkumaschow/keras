# Image Prediction Script using Keras and VGG19

Just following tutorial from here:

https://machinelearningmastery.com/use-pre-trained-vgg-model-classify-objects-photographs/

Except I'm using VGG19 instead of VGG16. Predictions are more accurate.

Besides the python requirements it will help to have Nvidia GPU and Cuda Toolkit installed.

I'm using a 1060.
